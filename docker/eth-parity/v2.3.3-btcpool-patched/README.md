Docker for Parity Ethereum Node
============================

* OS: `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`
* Docker image: build by yourself
* Parity version: 2.3.3 with patched `eth_getWork`

## Install Docker CE

```
# Use official mirrors
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker

# Or use Aliyun mirrors
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun
```

## Change Image Mirrors and Data Root (optional)

```
mkdir -p /work/docker
vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

```
{
    "registry-mirrors": ["https://<REPLACED-TO-YOUR-MIRROR-ID>.mirror.aliyuncs.com"],
    "data-root": "/work/docker"
}
```

```
service docker restart
```

## Build Docker Image

```
git clone --depth=1 -b v2.3.3-btcpool https://github.com/btccom/parity-ethereum.git
cd parity-ethereum
docker build -t parity:2.3.3-btcpool -f scripts/docker/alpine/Dockerfile .
```

## Create Config Files

Tips:
* Set a different `<node-id>` for each node to ensure results of getwork are unique.

## Start Docker Container

### Ethereum

```
# start docker
docker run -it -v /work/ethereum/eth-parity/:/home/parity/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/ -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 --name eth-parity --restart always -d parity:2.3.3-btcpool

# see the log
tail -f /work/ethereum/eth-parity/parity.log

# login
docker exec -it eth-parity /bin/bash
```

### Ethereum Classic

```
# start docker
docker run -it -v /work/ethereum/etc-parity/:/home/parity/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/ -p 8555:8545 -p 30403:30303 --name etc-parity --restart always -d parity:2.3.3-btcpool

# see the log
tail -f /work/ethereum/etc-parity/parity.log

# login
docker exec -it eth-parity /bin/bash
```

## How to upgrade from old deploment

The old version of the parity container running with the user `root`,
but now it running with the user `parity`.

So before upgrading to the new version, you need to do some extra works, otherwise Parity will not able to start.

The following command shows what you need to do:

### For Ethereum

```
# Stop and remove the old container
docker stop eth-parity
docker rm eth-parity

# The new user name is parity, its uid = 1000 and gid = 1000
chown -R 1000:1000 /work/ethereum/eth-parity

# Paths in config file need to update
sed -i 's@/root/@/home/parity/@g' /work/ethereum/eth-parity/config.toml

# Now you can run the new container
docker run -it -v /work/ethereum/eth-parity/:/home/parity/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/ -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 --name eth-parity --restart always -d parity:2.3.3-btcpool

# Check if Parity is running properly
tail -F /work/ethereum/eth-parity/parity.log

# If it not running properly, you can debug it
docker stop eth-parity
docker rm eth-parity
docker run -it -v /work/ethereum/eth-parity/:/home/parity/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/ -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 --name eth-parity --entrypoint=/bin/bash parity:2.3.3-btcpool
```

### For Ethereum Classic

```
# Stop and remove the old container
docker stop etc-parity
docker rm etc-parity

# The new user name is parity, its uid = 1000 and gid = 1000
chown -R 1000:1000 /work/ethereum/etc-parity

# Paths in config file need to update
sed -i 's@/root/@/home/parity/@g' /work/ethereum/etc-parity/config.toml

# Now you can run the new container
docker run -it -v /work/ethereum/etc-parity/:/home/parity/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/ -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 --name etc-parity --restart always -d parity:2.3.3-btcpool

# Check if Parity is running properly
tail -F /work/ethereum/etc-parity/parity.log

# If it not running properly, you can debug it
docker stop etc-parity
docker rm etc-parity
docker run -it -v /work/ethereum/etc-parity/:/home/parity/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/ -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 --name etc-parity --entrypoint=/bin/bash parity:2.3.3-btcpool
```
